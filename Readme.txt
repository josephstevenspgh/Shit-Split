ShitSplit v04

* About
 This was primarily created for HDL, and his Sonic 3 & Knuckles Tails Any% speedruns. However more people have expressed interest, so it's now just a general-purpose gametime split program. For feedback, suggestions, whatever, talk to setz in #sega, on irc.speedrunslive.com
 Shitsplit is open source with no restrictions, however if you make an improvement, it'd be cool if you shared it.

* Prereqs
 You need to have Python 2.7 to run this -- It is very important that you have python 2.7, as 3.x is something entirely different.

* How to use
-- Main Window
 press S to start splitting
 press R to restart splitting
 press shift+S to save splits, only works after inputting last split, you'll need to restart the application to see the  new splits
-- Time Input Window
 Return/Enter - Submits the time
 + Key - Allows you to add time together within the split
 - Key - Similar to the + key, except treats the time as negative
-- Creating Splitfiles
 Create (or copy) a new file in the "Splits" folder. The format is in plaintext, you can see how to create new files by looking at the examples bundled with ShitSplit.
 See Example.ss in the Splits folder for more information

* Things that will be made easier later
 To change the splits, edit ShitSplit.py in a text editor, change the filename to whatever filename you want it to read
